## Major Economic Events Explained

### 1. **FOMC Interest Rate Decision** 🔴 High Impact

**What it is**:
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 8 times per year to decide the federal funds rate - the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.

**Why it matters**:
- **Interest rates control money supply** - Higher rates = stronger dollar, lower stock prices
- **Inflation control** - Fed raises rates to cool down inflation
- **Employment impact** - Lower rates stimulate job growth
- **Global ripple effect** - US rates affect global currencies and commodities

**Trading Impact**:
- **Stocks**: Rate hikes typically negative (↓), rate cuts positive (↑)
- **Dollar**: Rate hikes strengthen USD (↑), cuts weaken it (↓)
- **Gold**: Inversely correlated with rates (rates ↑ = gold ↓)
- **Bonds**: Prices fall when rates rise

**When**: 8 times per year (every ~6 weeks)
- Usually announced at 2:00 PM EST
- Press conference follows 30 minutes later

**How to Trade**:
- **Before**: Markets are nervous, low volume, tight ranges
- **During**: Extreme volatility - avoid trading
- **After**: New trend forms based on decision + guidance
- **Best strategy**: Wait 30-60 minutes for dust to settle, then trade the new trend

**How to Trade**:
- **Highest volatility event** - can move markets 200+ pips in seconds
- **Avoid trading 8:25-9:00 AM EST** if you're a beginner
- **Best strategy**: Wait for initial spike to settle (15-30 min), trade the retracement

**Historical Note**:
- Strong NFP (300,000+ jobs) often followed by Fed rate hikes
- Weak NFP (< 100,000 jobs) can signal recession

### 3. **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** 🔴 High Impact

- **Lower than expected** (cooling inflation):
  - Stocks ↑ (no more rate hikes)
  - USD ↓ (dovish Fed)
  - Gold ↑

**When**: Around 13th of every month at 8:30 AM EST

**How to Trade**:
- **Wait for the number** - don't guess
- **Watch for revision** - previous month's data gets revised
- **Compare to expectations** - deviation from forecast creates volatility
- **Best strategy**: Fade the initial spike if it's extreme (>0.3% surprise)

**Example**:
- Expected: 3.0% | Actual: 3.5% → "Hot" inflation → Markets sell off
- Expected: 3.0% | Actual: 2.6% → "Cool" inflation → Markets rally

## Pro Tips

### 1. **The First Move is Often Wrong**
- Markets spike in one direction, then reverse
- Wait 5-15 minutes for the "real" move

### 2. **Whisper Numbers**
- Wall Street insiders have better forecasts than public consensus
- If actual matches whisper but beats consensus, minimal reaction

### 3. **Previous Revisions Matter**
- NFP often revises previous month by ±50,000 jobs
- Watch for revisions buried in the report

### 4. **Fed Speakers > Data**
- What Fed Chair says matters MORE than individual data points
- "Fed put" - Fed will support markets if they fall too much

### 5. **Pre-Event Positioning**
- Markets often "price in" expected outcomes
- Big surprise = big move
- Expected outcome = "sell the news"
